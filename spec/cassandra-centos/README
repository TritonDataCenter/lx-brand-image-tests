This test will only work for lx images that have CentOS 6 or 7 operating system.

To run the test, you need to execute a bash shell script on a Linux test client machine,
which will then exercise the test cases, written in Ruby, and using the serverspec
test framework.
  
The reason you have to execute the bash shell script for this test (as opposed to
just running the serverspec test script directly using rake) is that this is more of
integration test suite that creates multiple instances, installs and configures
software on the instances, then starts the server and test client processes in a
certain order.

1) On a Linux test client machine, do git clone:
   https://github.com/joyent/lx-brand-image-tests.

2) Cd to the "lx-brand-image-tests" directory, and execute the following command:

	./run-cassandra-centos.sh

	(This is print out the usage statements for you.)

3) To start the test, execute the script "run-cassandra-centos.sh" with the correct
   parameter values.  For example:

	./run-cassandra-centos.sh -i centos-7 -k g4-general-8G -p us-east-3b

   You can enter either the Name or the UUID for <IMAGE> or <PACKAGE>.
